# IVOR Grant Proposal - Progressive Social Justice Foundation

**To:** Progressive Social Justice Foundation - Grants Committee
**From:** BLKOUT Collective - IVOR Community Liberation Initiative
**Re:** Community-Controlled AI for Black LGBTQ+ Liberation and Health Equity

---

## **Project Overview: Technology in Service of Liberation**

The **IVOR (Intelligent Virtual Organizer for Resilience)** project represents a groundbreaking initiative to develop **community-controlled artificial intelligence** that serves Black LGBTQ+ liberation through culturally-competent health support, community organizing assistance, and collective power building.

### **Alignment with Foundation Priorities**

IVOR directly advances your foundation's core commitments:
- **Racial Justice**: Addressing health disparities affecting Black communities
- **LGBTQ+ Liberation**: Culturally-affirming support for gender and sexuality diversity
- **Community Power Building**: Democratic technology development and cooperative ownership
- **Systemic Change**: Transforming how marginalized communities access and control technology
- **Intersectional Analysis**: Centering experiences of multiply-marginalized community members

## **The Problem: Technology Oppression vs. Technology Liberation**

### **Current Technology Landscape**
**Extractive Tech Industry:**
- **Surveillance capitalism** extracting value from marginalized communities
- **Algorithmic bias** perpetuating systemic racism and queerphobia
- **Platform exploitation** with no community ownership or control
- **Health AI systems** trained on privileged populations, ineffective for marginalized communities

**Community Impact:**
- **Digital redlining** limiting access to technology resources and opportunities
- **Cultural incompetence** in AI systems serving diverse communities
- **Economic extraction** with profits flowing away from communities creating value
- **Democratic deficit** in technology development affecting community lives

### **Specific Challenges for Black LGBTQ+ Communities**
- **Mental health crisis** with 3x higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation
- **Healthcare discrimination** leading to delayed care and health outcome disparities
- **Limited culturally-competent resources** for community-specific health and social needs
- **Social isolation** due to family rejection, workplace discrimination, and systemic marginalization
- **Crisis support gaps** with mainstream services lacking cultural competency and community connection
