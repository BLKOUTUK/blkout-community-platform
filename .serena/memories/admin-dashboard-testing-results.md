# Admin Dashboard Testing Results

## Current Status
- **Database Schema**: ✅ Successfully applied to Supabase with sample data
- **API Endpoints**: ✅ Created at `/api/admin/stats.ts` and `/api/admin/moderation-queue.ts` 
- **Community API**: ✅ Updated to call real endpoints instead of mock data
- **Development Server**: ✅ Running at http://localhost:3000/

## Issue Identified
- **Development API Routes**: ❌ Vite doesn't process Vercel API routes in development mode
- **Solution**: API routes only work when deployed to Vercel production environment

## Database Integration Status
- **Supabase Tables Created**:
  - `moderation_queue` with 2 sample submissions
  - `admin_stats` with real metrics tracking
  - `community_members` with admin profiles

## Next Steps for Live Testing
1. Deploy to Vercel to test API routes with real database
2. Verify admin dashboard shows real data instead of fallback mock data
3. Test moderation actions (approve/reject) with real database updates

## Real Data Structure Ready
- Liberation values compliance tracking (75% creator sovereignty)
- Community governance metrics 
- Trauma-informed moderation queues
- Democratic participation statistics
