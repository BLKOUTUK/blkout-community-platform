# BLKOUT Platform Moderation System Architecture Analysis

## Executive Summary

The BLKOUT platform has a comprehensive, multi-layered moderation system that was designed to support community-driven content curation with liberation values at its core. The system is **functionally complete but requires integration work** to make all components accessible and properly connected.

## System Architecture Overview

### 1. Database Schema (Core Infrastructure) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Primary Content Tables:**
- `newsroom_articles` (299 records) - Main article content with full moderation workflow
- `events` (27 records) - Community events with approval workflow  
- `moderation_queue` (25 records) - Chrome extension submission staging area
- `moderation_log` (4 records) - Audit trail for all moderation actions
- `community_reviews` - Peer review system for articles/events

**Key Moderation Fields in Tables:**
```sql
-- newsroom_articles & events both have:
status: 'draft' | 'review' | 'published' | 'archived'
moderated_by: UUID (references community_members)
moderated_at: timestamp
approved_by: UUID (references auth.users)
approved_at: timestamp  
rejected_by: UUID (references auth.users)
rejected_at: timestamp
rejection_reason: text
priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
```

**Community Governance Integration:**
- `community_members` table with role hierarchy: 'member' | 'moderator' | 'admin' | 'founder'
- `community_reviews` for democratic content evaluation
- `community_contributions` for tracking moderation participation

### 2. Authentication & Authorization System ‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL

**Admin Authentication:**
- File: `/src/components/admin/AdminAuth.tsx`
- **Credentials**: admin/blkOUT2025! and moderator/blkOUT2025!
