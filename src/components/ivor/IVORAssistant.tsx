2. Identify your needs and feelings without blame

4. Seek to understand before being understood
5. Focus on impact over intent

- You are worthy of love and care exactly as you are
- It's okay to feel multiple things at once

- Mutual aid is solidarity, not charity

- What beauty can you bring to the movement?

**Creative Prompts:**
- Create something that celebrates community resilience
